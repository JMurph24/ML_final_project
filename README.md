# Ml_Final_project_CNN
Implementing Fully Convolutional Neural Networks

# Steps
1. Loading the data
2. Preprocessing the data (Resized the data to have same size (224 x 224))
3. create the model
4. compute the loss
5. choose the optimization algorithm
6. evaluate the metrics and compute IOU(Intersection over union)
7. Train and test the model
8. plot the images and loss over different learning rate
