# Ml_Final_project_CNN
Implementing Fully Convolutional Neural Networks

# process
Loading the data
Preprocessing the data (Resized the data to have same size (224 x 224))
create the model
compute the loss
choose the optimization algorithm
evaluate the metrics and compute IOU(Intersection over union)
Train and test the model
